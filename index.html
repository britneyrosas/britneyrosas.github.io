        <h2>About this Website</h2>
        <p>Hey!</p>
        <p>I started this website as a personal project in Winter 2023. It was something I had been thinking about for a while,
            and I finally decided to turn it into a reality during my winter break. While web development isn't something I usually
            gravitate toward, I took this opportunity to dive into a new skill set, and I had a lot of fun along the way. I hope you
            enjoy exploring it as much as I enjoyed creating it!

    <section id="about">
        <div>
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> I'm currently in my fourth year at UC San Diego, pursuing a degree in Mechanical Engineering. </p>
            <p> When I started college, I had no background in engineering. My initial interest was in Biology, which transitioned into Bioengineering,
                and finally evolved into Mechanical Engineering. It wasn’t until I completed my first two undergraduate physics that I realized engineering
                was the path for me. Not surprisingly I've always been interested in solving puzzles and enjoy setting challenges for myself. Gaining technical
                experience from my extracurricular activities was very important to me from the get-go and has allowed me to hone-in on my professional pursuits.
                I’ve grown so much since the start of my college career and seeking opportunities for myself has definitely played a big role in that. My more
                recent roles within RPL and General Atomics have been very rewarding and have solidified my interest in pursuing a role within the Aerospace Industry.
            </p>
            <p> Outside of school, I love spending time outdoors. I recently went on a backpacking trip to Yosemite, which was incredible — I even saw a bear!
                It was one of those moments that reminded me of why I love being in nature. Spending several days disconnected from the routines of everyday life
                gave me a deep appreciation for the simplicity and beauty of the wilderness. With that adventure still fresh in my mind, I’m already planning my
                next — a solo backpacking trip later this year. The idea of heading out alone, relying entirely on what I carry on my back, feels both thrilling
                and challenging. I’ve come to really enjoy the self-sufficiency that backpacking demands and the mental clarity it brings. Hiking is usually something
                I reserve for longer breaks, but when I'm not on the trails, I stay active by running. Distance running has been a passion since high school, and
                after completing my first half-marathon in May 2023, I’m excited to tackle more races in the future.

            <h3>ROCKET PROPULSION LABORATORY</h3>
            <p> I joined Rocket Propulsion Laboratory (RPL) in October 2022 as part of the New Member Project (NMP),
                where I was introduced to hands-on rocket design and engineering. Through NMP, I collaborated closely
                with other members and gained practical skills in CAD development and simulation setup using tools like
                OpenRocket and SOLIDWORKS. The project culminated in the successful launch of G-class model rockets at
                Friends of Amateur Rocketry in California, an experience that solidified my foundational knowledge and
                passion for rocketry.
            </p>
           <p> After completing NMP, I joined the Osiris Structures team. Osiris is RPL’s new and first multi-stage solid propellant rocket,
                designed to compete in the 2025 Spaceport America Cup, an intercollegiate rocket engineering competition. As part of
                the Structures team, I’ve conducted quantitative analyses of materials and geometries for Osiris’s external structure
                through simulations. My work involves optimizing composite laminates and isotropic components using SOLIDWORKS and ANSYS,
                including Ansys ACP for failure analysis and performance validation. At our current pace, we aim to finalize design and
                manufacturing by the end of this school year. 
            </p>
            <p> In my current role as Structures Lead Engineer, I oversee the structural design of the rocket and ensure that all components meet
                rigorous safety and performance standards. As the team's Safety Officer, I maintain a thorough understanding of our manufacturing processes,
                particularly fiber composite layup procedures, and develop safety protocols to ensure compliance during production. I have also lead sub team
                training sessions to ensure high-quality fabrication and adherence to safety regulations.

Being a part of RPL has been incredibly rewarding. Each new challenge pushes me to expand my skillset beyond my current expertise. What makes Osiris particularly
                meaningful is the shared ambition to push the limits of what's possible in student rocketry. This is the most long-term project I’ve committed to,
                and I’m eagerly looking forward to seeing our hard work come to fruition at the 2025 Spaceport America Cup.

            <h3>GENERAL ATOMICS</h3>
            <p>My time at General Atomics was an invaluable hands-on learning experience, where I supported the structural analysis of mechanical components for UCAVs
                (Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles). Using NX and Ansys, I was responsible for applying loads, setting boundary conditions, and optimizing mesh models to
                simulate real-world conditions. What made this experience particularly rewarding was the chance to dive deep into Finite Element Analysis (FEA), where I
                was able to truly understand the theory I had learned in my classes and see its practical application. For the first time, I wasn’t just learning about FEA
                in the abstract — I was applying it thoughtfully to models, balancing accuracy with efficiency.
            </p> 
            <p>I took away an important lesson from this experience: "All models are trash, but some are useful." As I iterated on designs through model combination methods
            and optimized through material selection and structural relief cutouts, I learned that no simulation is perfect, but they are invaluable tools when approached with
            the right mindset. This principle has reshaped my approach to solving real engineering problems and has fueled my enthusiasm for my current work at RPL.
            </p>
            <p>In addition to FEA, I used Excel extensively for data analysis, managing complex kinematic datasets, and generating tolerance reports. This work ensured that
                subcomponent selections were optimized, aligning with design specifications and ensuring the reliability of the systems we were working on. Exposure to GD&T
                principles was also a key part of my role, as I learned to balance precision with practicality in design.
            </p>
            <p>I also contributed to internal technical reviews, creating over 90 slides of detailed artifact documentation that supported comprehensive assessments of various
                components. Lastly, I had the opportunity to oversee Linear Actuator Hardware Testing in GA's testing lab, where I managed test procedures, analyzed results, and
                ensured thorough documentation — a critical process that ensured the effectiveness of the hardware.

            <p> Stanley!!!!</p>
            <p> This was my first internship ever. I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity to spend that summer in Seattle (I love Seattle in the Summer). 
                Working for Stanley 1913 was both exciting and rewarding. I gained hands-on experience in product design, from concept development and material 
                selection to prototyping with SOLIDWORKS and 3D printing. I learned a great deal about manufacturing processes and metal forming techniques, and 
                it was inspiring to see my work contribute directly to the team’s projects. Stanley is and HAS
                been a big name, but it was very exciting to be working in their office before they got their BIG break in 2023.
